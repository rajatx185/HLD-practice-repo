# NoSQL DBS

- Handle Large volumes of data and traffic
- flexible schema
- Easy to scale horizontally
- pace of development is much faster than SQL
- supports many different data
- affordable
- supports zero downtime and scale
- new application paradigms can be easily supported

## Document Dbs

- stores datas in JSON, BSON, XML documents
- documents can be nested
- particular elements can be indexed for faster querying (like indexing in SQL DBs but diff)
- documents can be stored and retrieved in a form that is much closer to the data objects used in apps..which means less serialization and deserialisation.
- data feels more like code
- scale out arch (clear path to scalability of both data volumes and traffic)
- ecommerce platforms, tradind platforms and mobile app dev

## key Value Stores

- stores data as key:value pairs

## Column Oriented dbs

- useful for analytics
- not strongly consistent

## graph db

- connections are first class elements
- social network, knowledge graph, fraud detection
- capture and search connection between different data elements. avoid joins
